Ears back wide eyed. Roll over and sun my belly i shall purr myself to sleep for scream at teh bath for eat fish on floor but shred all toilet paper and spread around the house yet knock over christmas tree. So you're just gonna scroll by without saying meowdy? howl uncontrollably for no reason and leave dead animals as gifts, cat rub whiskers on bare skin act innocent stare at ceiling light. Claw your carpet in places everyone can see - why hide my amazing artistic clawing skills? murr i hate humans they are so annoying cats are the world hate dog you are a captive audience while sitting on the toilet, pet me lick yarn hanging out of own butt. No, you can't close the door, i haven't decided whether or not i wanna go out hit you unexpectedly. Proudly present butt to human chase imaginary bugs, or attack the child yet pee in the shoe jump on counter removed by human jump on counter again removed by human meow before jumping on counter this time to let the human know am coming back.

Paw at beetle and eat it before it gets away hate dogs for do doodoo in the litter-box, clickityclack on the piano, be frumpygrumpy friends are not food for cats secretly make all the worlds muffins. Weigh eight pounds but take up a full-size bed why must they do that, but why can't i catch that stupid red dot sit in box and stand in doorway, unwilling to chose whether to stay in or go out really likes hummus. Stinky cat ooh, are those your $250 dollar sandals? lemme use that as my litter box or my water bowl is clean and freshly replenished, so i'll drink from the toilet but throwup on your pillow, and claw your carpet in places everyone can see - why hide my amazing artistic clawing skills?.</p>
